      <h1>About Rereading Children's Literature</h1>
<p>We're a book club dedicated to rereading children's literature. We gather monthly (usually around the East Bay) to talk about different books each month, chosen by our members.</p>

<p>Most of the books we discuss are books we read as children - hence, we're <i>rereading</i> them. We focus on novels and chapter books commonly read in late elementary or middle school (roughly ages 9-14), but we're also open to picture books, YA novels, and other stories aimed towards young people, published in any era.</p>

<p>By the way, all of us are 18+. :) Members range widely in age and come from all walks of life, from college student to retired. Some of us work with children on a professional basis, and some of us just like a book club with easy-to-read literary assignments.</p>

<p>Our group was founded on Meetup in October 2016, and we moved to our own website four years later.</p>

<h2>FAQ</h2>

<p><a class="btn btn-primary" data-toggle="collapse" href="#q1" role="button" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="collapseExample">Why Are You Rereading Children's Literature?</a>
<div class="collapse" id="q1">
  <div>
  	<p>We explore how stories have stuck with us over the years and why we still remember them fondly -- or discover why they don't resonate anymore. It's interesting to see which books have held up and which ones have proven to be disenchanting. We like to see what makes books memorable and resonant, even as our perspectives change dramatically as we age.</p>

  	<p>As adults, it's normal to feel a sense of nostalgia when rereading old favorites. Stories have shaped our values and identity. They inspire people to take on certain careers, move to faraway locales, and contemplate their place in the world. Children's books arguably have an outsized impact on readers.</p>

<p>To quote SF Said in The Guardian: "It's striking how long children's books can last. One explanation may be the way in which they're read. They become part of our emotional autobiographies, acquiring associations and memories, more like music than prose. Another explanation may lie in the fact that children's books are designed with re-reading in mind."</p>

<p><a class="btn btn-primary" data-toggle="collapse" href="#q2" role="button" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="collapseExample">Where Do You Meet?</a>
<div class="collapse" id="q2">
  <div>
<p>We usually meet at cafes in the East Bay of the San Francisco Bay Area, in cities including Berkeley, Oakland, Hayward, and Fremont. Sometimes we'll chat in parks and members' homes, or venture to locations in the South Bay. We are open to switching locations to meet our members' needs.</p>

<p>Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have been meeting on Zoom since March 2020.</p>
</div></div></p>

<p><a class="btn btn-primary" data-toggle="collapse" href="#q3" role="button" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="collapseExample">What Are Group Meetings Like?</a>
<div class="collapse" id="q3">
  <div>
<p>Please RSVP for the meeting(s) you wish to attend - this helps us select locations and prep. We're usually easy to spot at the cafes we go to - some of us will have copies of the assigned books in front of us. Feel free to order coffee or food before or during the meeting.</p>

<p>Our meetings usually attract 5-10 people and last 1.5-2 hours. Sometimes we'll have an icebreaker at the beginning of the meeting to introduce everyone. Then the members who recommended the assigned books will begin with a few thought-provoking questions to discuss the books. We like a variety of opinions - it's ok to say you didn't like the books! The conversation is open, relaxed, and respectful.</p>

<p>At the end of each meeting, we wrap up with a discussion on future meetings (books, dates, locations).</p>

<p>We also occasionally have non-book discussion meetings -- sometimes we'll watch movies or TV, games, or go on road trips together (ok, the road trip has only happened once so far).</p></div></div></p>

<p>Check out <a href="./cal/events.html">our Events page</a> to see the full list of books read by the group.</p> 

<p>As of September 2020, we've met almost 50 times and have read an average of two books per meeting... which is to say we've read a LOT of books already (and have lots more to go!).</p>

<p>Short list of books we've tackled:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Eleanor & Park</i></li>
<li><i>Little Women</i></li>
<li><i>Hatchet</i></li>
<li><i>Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret</i></li>

</ul>

<p><a class="btn btn-primary" data-toggle="collapse" href="#q5" role="button" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="collapseExample">How Are Books Chosen?</a>
<div class="collapse" id="q5">
  <div>
<p>We often discuss future books at the end of our meetings. The organizer also messages individual members for their suggestions for later months. We try to make sure everyone gets a chance to recommend books after they've attended a few meetings, and preferably host a book discussion at least once or twice a year.</p>
</div></div></p>

<p><a class="btn btn-primary" data-toggle="collapse" href="#q6" role="button" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="collapseExample">Can I Come to an Event if I Didn't Read These Books as a Child?</a>
<div class="collapse" id="q6">
  <div>

<p>Of course! We often read two books for each discussion -- you may join in even if you have only read one of the listed books before, or neither. You may have to read with some of the following questions in mind if you haven't encountered the books before: How would a child read this book? What about it would appeal to my younger self?</p>

<p>There's always a few people attending who haven't read the books before.</p>
</div></div></p>

<p><a class="btn btn-primary" data-toggle="collapse" href="#q7" role="button" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="collapseExample">What Are The Requirements To Becoming a Member?</a>
<div class="collapse" id="q7">
  <div>

<p>We welcome everyone interested in children's literature! However, please note that meetings are intended for adults, not children. Please expect to read 1-2 books (40-100k words) per meeting. We currently meet every three to five weeks. There are no attendance requirements - you don't have to attend every meeting. We may occasionally assess the memberships of those who haven't come to a meeting in a long time.</p>

<p>In the past, we have required new members to be able to come to our physical East Bay meetings. As of September 2020, we are meeting on Zoom and would consider join requests from people living outside of the Bay Area.</p>
